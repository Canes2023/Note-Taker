# Note-Taker

For this assignment, I was tasked to create a functional note taker application. The starter code was provided by the instructor but the application wasn't functional. When running the script, the app wouldn't load on the page. I had to fix that by reworking the server.js and index.js code. I was quite difficult and unfortunately, I wasn't able to complete the entire process. I didn't get the sidebar of created notes made and update the UI to make it resemble the mock up animation. I tried for hours and hours but kept getting errors so I reverted back to my original code where it was functional and decided to leave it as is. I am not sure what I could have done to fix it but I will figure it out. For now, the user can add a title and description for their notes and save it or create a new note but the saved notes won't go anywhere.
